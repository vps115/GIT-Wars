# That's what *** Said

The most amazing guy in the whole office. Great at improv. Someone who doesn't get, rather try to get the work done. Starred in his own film "Threat Level Midnight" as Agent Michael Scarn. And also he's the BOSS (world's best boss).

He's Dope.

# Hints
- He takes bad decision, but can't help it. 
- Now he wants you to merge branch 'toby' into branch 'michael' and after doing it continue reading the instructions.

- Now the office revolves around michael and his problems, so it's evitable for this branch to not have many issues with other branches.  

- He's a tricky guy, he has hid a hint in the commit message of the 2nd commit. Extract it, follow it and then move unto next instructions. 

- Now, you can merge the jim branch to michael branch and give conflict priority to changes in jim branch.

- I see you have reached a milestone. Now wait till new updates are pushed and meanwhile I have a question for you "Which bears are best blue or black?".

# You have come to the right place

LISTEN, there are two ways to pronounce the branch-name (dev), if you are pronouncing it the 2nd way -- I am disappointed :).
<br />
<br />

# But Let's Talk Real World
- Each branch has a motif that it exist, when your project gets bigger and bigger you cannot afford to break your working/stable code. 
- This dev branch basically means that, the developers are working on new features, fixes or updates on this branch. They can try new things which are often assigned by the project leads.
- As soon as the features/updates in comes close to stable, the features of this branch are merged in the main branch.  

# Hints
- You as a developer need to add some changes to this branch.
- You need to merge branch michael into branch dev and give conflict priority to changes in michael branch.
- You need to merge branch rachael into dev branch and give conflict priority to changes in rachael branch. 
- The admin asks you to edit the 3rd line in the code.md line to 8.
- The admin wants you to commit these changes, the commit message format should be very specific like: "edit code.md line 3: 9 -> 8". This is important since often at times these desciptive message are useful. Any good developer will appreciate this.
- Lets talk about atomic commits. Only group commit multiple changes if they are related. 
- The lead asked you to change the first line in dev.md file, replace "You have come to the right place" to "Road to Software Engineer" after the '#'.
- Commit these new changes using appropriate commit message according to you (this won't be judged, so don't worry). Just want to know if you learned something.
- You are good to go.
- switch your branch to test (do not merge anything as of yet)
